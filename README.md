Chatbot powered by OpenAI and Stanford Philosophy Encyclopedia

I wanted to make a chatbot that can answer philosophical questions by simulating certain philosophers.

This is meant to be a fun, educational tool, but we should take its results with a grain of salt.


## Prompt engineering

First, I wanted to make a chat interface, so that it would look and feel like you're texting a philosopher.

In addition, I wanted to try prompt-engineering the majority of the project. Essentially, what that means is that I will
export the prompts and responses from ChatGPT to document how I built the project.
